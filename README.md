CATALOG INFO

Custom thumbnails for everything.

All in game names begin with GE and the item type, so they are easy to find. 
For example: GE Wallpaper - Wings, GE Sofa Damask, etc. 

All Walls cost 8 Simoleons per panel and are found in the Wallpaper section.

This set began with the walls simply entitled Gothic Elegance, and I put the darkest black plain wall swatch in with it, so it's easy to match with the rest of the patterns in the set, all with the same black colour. The other plain wall colours are in their own packages.

All walls come in full wallpaper, and wallpaper with black molding versions.

The sofa comes in a damask pattern with black wood accents, and costs 1200 Simoleons.

The loveseat comes in a plain version with black wood accents, and costs 1100 Simoleons.

There are 3 living chair packages, all with black wood accents: Damask, Plain, and Roses. They all cost 410 Simoleons.

There are 10 packages for paintings, and all are found in Decorations>Paintings and Posters. 6 are an altered mesh of a base game item, simply reduced in size.
